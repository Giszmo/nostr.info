## What is nostr?

"nostr" stands for "**N**otes and **O**ther **S**tuff **T**ransmitted by
**R**elays" and is an open protocol for censorship-resistant global networks
created by [@fiatjaf](https://github.com/fiatjaf).

You can find a very decent overview of tools and projects at
[aljazceru/awesome-nostr](https://github.com/aljazceru/awesome-nostr)!

## What is nostr.info?

Nostr.info was registered to provide meaningful information for the nostr
ecosystem. For developers and users alike.

The current state might be more a playground but features to come are:

- Show all events and help the user interpret them. Check out
  [Relays](/relays/). It already gives some idea of recent events.
- Show all relays and their features and performance - a bit like
  [nostr.watch](https://nostr.watch/). [Relays](/relays/)
  already does this a bit but expect a lot more to come!
- Provide a nostr client under this domain
- Charts like on [nostr.band](https://stats.nostr.band)
  - Events per hour/day/week
  - Split by kind/size
  - Active pubkeys per hour/day/week
  - Follows graphs - and how they change over time
- A reliable, fast relay that scales with its demand
